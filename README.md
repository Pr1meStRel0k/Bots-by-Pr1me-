# Bots-by-Pr1me-
This repository contains the source code for Discord bots and a Telegram bot. I understand the bots are still very rough, but they might still be useful to someone.
Important clarification: The code works, provided you insert all your tokens, channel IDs, and so on.
I also understand that the code is very crude, but for a very weak base, it's good enough.
